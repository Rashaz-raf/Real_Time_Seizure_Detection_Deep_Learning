## Abstract
This project leverages deep learning to create a highly accurate seizure detection system using wearable devices. Multimodal sensors (e.g., Electrodermal Activity and Accelerometers) capture physiological data, allowing real-time prediction of seizures. The goal is to offer non-invasive, continuous monitoring for individuals with epilepsy, significantly enhancing their quality of life.

## System Overview
A wearable-based solution that uses advanced deep learning models to predict seizures by analyzing physiological changes. With real-time alerts and high detection accuracy, the system aims to redefine epilepsy care.

## Methodology
Data from wearable sensors is preprocessed and used to train deep learning models like CNN and LSTM for classification. The models are evaluated on performance metrics such as accuracy, recall, and F1-score. The dataset used for this project is available from [Eval.ai](https://eval.ai/web/challenges/challenge-page/1693/overview).

## Results
The study highlights the effectiveness of the CNN-LSTM model, achieving a 97.4% accuracy rate in detecting seizures. The system provides real-time alerts, enhancing timely intervention and improving patient care.

## Conclusion
Deep learning-based wearable systems present a transformative approach to epilepsy care, offering precise and real-time seizure detection. Future work will focus on clinical trials and healthcare system integration.
